This is a simple web application for adding/searching hotels in Sri Lanka. Application consists of two
web pages one for entering the details of the hotels and the other for city based search
including sorting.

You can add hotel name, address and the hotel location/city in the hotel detail adding page.

To search the hotels type the city name. If there are hotels available in that city it will display the hotel names.
(I have created a keyup event for city based search.)

Instructions for running the project:
Create the database using given 'hotelsDB.sql' .
Then change the database username,password in .env file.
Create a folder  named 'laravel' in webroot directory.
Put the hotelApp folder in laravel folder.
Then go to the following url:
http://localhost/laravel/hotelApp/public/
